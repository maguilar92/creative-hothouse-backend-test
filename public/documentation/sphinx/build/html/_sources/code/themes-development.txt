Theme development

If it's the first time, we must install the dependencies of the package.json with the command::

$ ./dcp npm install -d="Themes/Www"

If this is not the case, we execute ::

$ ./dcp npm update -d="Themes/Www"

Then to change the frontend, we simply execute::

$ ./dcp npm run watch -d="Themes/Www"

Now your changes will be listened and apllied :=)
